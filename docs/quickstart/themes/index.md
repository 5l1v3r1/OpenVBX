#Getting Started#

###Overview###

Theming your install of OpenVBX is very easy.  Out of the box there are a few example themes at the ready for you to use and experiment with. In this quickstart we&rsquo;re going to create a new monkey theme for OpenVBX by Changing the default logo to something with a monkey on it, and then we&rsquo;re going to change the colors of the left nav. Finally we&rsquo;re going to change the colors on the tabs you see on some pages. There is a lot more you can do beyond changing the styles of your OpenVBX install, but those are the basics we&rsquo;re going to go over now. If you would like to learn more about styling OpenVBX you can consult the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/themes/">Theming API</a>.

###Getting Started###
 
To begin we need to create a new directory in your `/assets/themes/` folder. You should name the directory the name you want for your new theme, make sure it&rsquo;s a one word name, in this example I&rsquo;m going to name the file monkey. Inside of your new directory we need to create a css file called `style.css` and another directory called for images called images. Images is where any files you need for your theme will go, and `style.css` is where your CSS will go.
