<!-- BASICS -->
<div class="section-box">
	<h3 class="section-box-heading">What does OpenVBX do? How?</h3>
	<p class="section-sub-blurb"><strong>OpenVBX is an open source PHP/MySQL application</strong> that helps developers build rich, high quality Internet phone and SMS applications. OpenVBX provides a modern user interface for end-users and a complete API for developers.</p>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
	<h3 class="section-box-heading">How is OpenVBX different from Twilio?</h3>
	<p class="section-sub-blurb">OpenVBX is an open source project started by Twilio that is powered by Twilio&rsquo;s hosted phone and SMS service. In order to make and receive phone calls using OpenVBX, you must have a Twilio.com account. OpenVBX extends Twilio&rsquo;s API by providing a user interface and other primitives like voicemail that build upon Twilio&rsquo;s core API stack.  OpenVBX is designed to be extensible by developers, and ease to use by end users.</p>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
	<h3 class="section-box-heading">Is the OpenVBX software hosted and supported by you?</h3>
	<p class="section-sub-blurb">OpenVBX runs on your servers. You can <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download/">download</a> and run OpenVBX on nearly any web server with PHP and MySQL installed. OpenVBX is a PHP application that provides a user-interface, database, integration and call control functionality. The actual voice and SMS functionality is provided by Twilio&rsquo;s cloud communications platform, which interacts in realtime with your installation of OpenVBX. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/">How it Works page</a> for more information.</p>
